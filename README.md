# Spring2022NMSU
Hello there future person! Not sure why you are browsing this git directory but I hope it helps you with your studies!


This is my github dir with my homework, notes, and labs from New Mexico State University Fall 2022. I am currently a undergrad CS major with several minors including Electrical Engineering. I have made this github so that future students can benefit from my mistakes and so that it is an open resource to people seeking a non-tradition education. 

The classes I am taking this year are:
CS370
EE317
CS488
EE512

Goodluck and please leave comments on things I messed up so both you and I can learn from that.
