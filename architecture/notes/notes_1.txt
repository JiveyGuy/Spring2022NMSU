Clock cycle time =  1/clock speed
CPU Time = clock cycle time * cycles per instructions * num instructions
exec time Cycle_t * CPI * instrs
Perf = clock speed * IPC * intrs
Speedup = new perf / old perf

Infl. tech for each:
	- Clock cycle time: Tech and pipeline
	- CPI: Architecture and instr set design
	- instructions count: instructions set design and compiler

CPI cannot be estimated analytically, s of IPC

Speedup is a ratio "This machine is 50% faster" = 

Ex Q: My new comp has a IPC that 20% less old comp, clock speed 30% higher, what is speed up? 

Sol: (new clck * new ipc) / (old clock * old ipc)
