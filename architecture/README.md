### Course Description

This is a core graduate course in the Computer Engineering Area starting Fall 2020. The course covers uniprocessors, caches, memory systems, virtual memory, storage systems, with an introduction to multiprocessor and distributed computer architectures; models of parallel computation; processing element, and interconnection network structures, and nontraditional architectures. Cross-listed with: EE 462/562.  Recommended preparation is EE 363, EE 212, or equivalent.

### Course Delivery Method

The course has sections that should/could meet face to face but the lecture are recorded using Panopto/Zoom. There are videos on youtube for a similar course at the University of Utah that would be useful to follow. You can tune in but for Las Cruces folks, it is best to come to class (only if explicitly asked to, you do not need/have to come with the pandemic in full force) you can just watch online. The course pace will be driven by what we cover and do in class. Attendance/Watching is highly needed. If you are an online student then you need to follow Canvas closely. Reading email and class announcements is crucial. I have more details on this that can be found in the following [course format page](https://nmsu.instructure.com/courses/1467463/pages/course-format "Course Format").

### Course Goals

Upon completing this course you will be able to:

1. Recognize the basic principles and current practices of computer architectures of processors, memory systems, interconnects, and input/output systems
2. Reason about the issues that influence the architectures of processors, memory systems, interconnects, and input/output systems
3. Evaluate and improve computer system performance through analysis and computer simulation
4. Solve and implement a small research problem in computer architecture.

### Textbooks and Materials

### The textbook we will use in this course is:

[Computer Architecture, 5th Edition A Quantitative Approach (Links to an external site.)](https://www.elsevier.com/books/computer-architecture/hennessy/978-0-12-383872-8)

**Authors:** John Hennessy and David Patterson  
**eBook ISBN:** 9780123838735  
**Paperback ISBN:** 9780123838728  
**Imprint:** Morgan Kaufmann  
**Published Date:** 16th September 2011  
**Page Count:** 856  
**Note, even though this is a 2011 edition of the book and there is a 2017 6th edition of the book which uses RISC-V instead of MIPS other than that the changes are not to the core of the material. I consciously chose the older edition.**

## Course Material

All course materials are required. There might be some optional assignments or discussions other than that everything else is required.  
**The Powerpoint slides, that I will post/use, have images that are either from the book or they come from the University of Utah with permission.**
